# Fail unless the XML output shows what the plugin's transform does to the
# sample project. Run with -DXML=<file>.
#
# `resize` is deprecated and has no documentation, so its brief is the message
# of its attribute. `getRadius` is deprecated too, but its author wrote a
# brief, which stays. A deprecated symbol with no message gets a brief that
# only says so. An overload set of deprecated functions with no documentation
# gets a brief for its own row in the namespace listing: the shared message
# of `retire`, and a plain "Deprecated." for `drop`, whose members differ.
# `Label` lists a copy of `legacy`, a deprecated member of a type
# of another library, and the copy gets the brief too. The transform leaves
# alone the symbols the documentation does not show: a hidden type in a
# `detail` namespace, and a type of another library that is only a dependency.
